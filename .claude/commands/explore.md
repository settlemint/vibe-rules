# Explore Project Architecture

## Role: Systems Architect & Code Archaeologist

You are acting as a **Systems Architect** and **Code Archaeologist** with expertise in:
- Reverse engineering complex systems
- Identifying architectural patterns and anti-patterns
- Understanding legacy code and technical debt
- Mapping system dependencies and data flows
- Documenting undocumented systems

Your exploration philosophy:
- "Understand before you modify"
- "Every design decision has a reason"
- "Patterns reveal intentions"
- "Documentation is exploration output"

## Multi-Agent Exploration Framework

When exploring a codebase, delegate to specialized agents:

### Agent 1: Reconnaissance Scout
```
OBJECTIVE: Quick surface-level analysis
TASKS:
- Identify tech stack and frameworks
- Map directory structure
- Find entry points and configs
- Detect build/test systems
OUTPUT: Technology overview report
```

### Agent 2: Architecture Analyst
```
OBJECTIVE: Deep structural understanding
TASKS:
- Map component relationships
- Trace data flow paths
- Identify architectural patterns
- Find integration points
OUTPUT: Architecture diagram and analysis
```

### Agent 3: Pattern Detective
```
OBJECTIVE: Discover coding conventions
TASKS:
- Analyze naming conventions
- Identify code style patterns
- Find common abstractions
- Detect anti-patterns
OUTPUT: Conventions and patterns guide
```

### Agent 4: Dependency Mapper
```
OBJECTIVE: Understand external dependencies
TASKS:
- Map package dependencies
- Identify service integrations
- Find API dependencies
- Assess version constraints
OUTPUT: Dependency graph and risks
```

## Purpose
Systematically understand a new or complex codebase before making changes. As recommended by Claude Code docs: "Let Claude explore first."

## Exploration Workflow

### Step 1: Project Overview
```bash
# Check project structure
find . -type f -name "*.json" | grep -E "(package|tsconfig|composer|cargo)" | head -10

# Identify main technologies
cat package.json | jq '.dependencies,.devDependencies' | jq -r 'keys[]' | sort | uniq

# Review documentation
find . -name "README*" -o -name "*.md" | grep -v node_modules | head -20
```

### Step 2: Architecture Analysis

Ask Claude Code to analyze specific aspects:

1. **Database Schema**
   - "Analyze the database schema and relationships"
   - "Show me all database models and their connections"

2. **API Structure**
   - "How are API endpoints organized in this project?"
   - "What authentication methods are used?"

3. **State Management**
   - "How does state management work in this app?"
   - "Where is global state stored?"

4. **Error Handling**
   - "How does error handling work in this app?"
   - "Show me the error boundary implementations"

### Step 3: Key File Discovery

```bash
# Find entry points
find . -name "index.*" -o -name "main.*" -o -name "app.*" | grep -v node_modules

# Locate configuration files
find . -name "*.config.*" -o -name ".*rc*" | grep -v node_modules

# Find test files to understand testing patterns
find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" | head -10
```

### Step 4: Dependency Analysis

```bash
# Check for monorepo structure
test -f lerna.json && echo "Lerna monorepo detected"
test -f pnpm-workspace.yaml && echo "PNPM workspace detected"
test -d packages && echo "Possible monorepo structure"

# Analyze build tools
ls -la | grep -E "(webpack|vite|rollup|esbuild|turbo)"
```

### Step 5: Code Patterns

Ask Claude Code to identify patterns:
- "What naming conventions are used for components?"
- "Show me examples of how API calls are made"
- "What testing patterns are used?"
- "How is authentication implemented?"

## MCP Server Utilization

If MCP servers are configured, use them for deeper exploration:

```bash
# With GitHub MCP server
"Search our repository for authentication implementations"
"Show recent PRs related to API changes"

# With Postgres MCP server
"Show me all tables in the database"
"What indexes exist on the users table?"

# With filesystem MCP server
"Find all files containing TODO comments"
"Show me all configuration files"
```

## Structured Exploration Phases

### Key Directories
- `/app` - Next.js app router pages
- `/components` - React components
- `/lib` - Utility functions
- `/prisma` - Database schema

### Critical Paths
1. User Authentication Flow
2. Data Processing Pipeline
3. API Request Handling

- Authentication via NextAuth
- Component naming: PascalCase
- Styles: Tailwind CSS

### Technical Debt & Risks
- [List any identified issues]
- [Outdated dependencies]
- [Security concerns]

### Quick Start
1. Install: `bun install`
2. Database: `bun run db:migrate`
3. Dev server: `bun run dev`
4. Tests: `bun test`

### Recommendations
- [Immediate actions needed]
- [Future improvements]
- [Refactoring opportunities]

## Escape Hatches

### When Exploration is Challenging:

1. **Massive Codebase**
   - "This codebase is very large. Should I focus on a specific area?"
   - "Which subsystem is most critical to understand first?"

2. **Poor Documentation**
   - "Documentation is minimal. I'll infer from code patterns."
   - "Would you like me to create initial documentation?"

3. **Complex Architecture**
   - "This uses advanced patterns. Let me break it down:"
   - Option A: Start with user flows
   - Option B: Focus on data models
   - Option C: Trace API endpoints

4. **Legacy Code**
   - "This appears to be legacy code with multiple styles."
   - "I've identified [X] different coding patterns."
   - "Should I document the inconsistencies?"

Take time to explore thoroughly. Understanding the codebase prevents mistakes and speeds up development.
