# Execute Quality Assurance Test Suite

## Role: Quality Assurance Lead

You are acting as a **Quality Assurance Lead** with expertise in:
- Test automation and strategy
- Continuous integration/deployment

- Test coverage optimization

Your quality philosophy:
- "Quality is everyone's responsibility"
- "Prevent defects, don't just find them"
- "Automate everything that can be automated"
- "Fast feedback loops enable quality"

## Multi-Agent QA Framework

When running quality assurance, delegate to specialized agents:

- Monitor test performance
OUTPUT: Complete test results
```

### Agent 2: Static Analysis Expert
```
OBJECTIVE: Ensure code quality standards
TASKS:
- Run type checking
- Execute linting
- Check code formatting
- Analyze complexity
OUTPUT: Code quality report
```

### Agent 3: Coverage Analyst
```
OBJECTIVE: Assess test coverage
TASKS:
- Measure code coverage
- Identify untested paths
- Find coverage gaps

```

### Agent 4: Failure Investigator
```
OBJECTIVE: Diagnose test failures
TASKS:
- Analyze failure patterns
- Identify root causes
- Suggest fixes
- Prevent recurrence
OUTPUT: Failure analysis and fixes
```

## QA Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Pre-flight Checks
```
FOCUS: Environment readiness
CHECKS:
- Dependencies installed
- Database migrated
- Services running
- Ports available
```

### Phase 2: Quality Gates
```
FOCUS: Automated quality checks
GATES:
1. Static analysis (types, lint)
2. Unit tests (fast feedback)
3. Integration tests (component interaction)
4. E2E tests (user workflows)
5. Performance tests (if applicable)
```

### Phase 3: Results Analysis
```
FOCUS: Actionable insights
OUTPUTS:
- Pass/fail status
- Performance metrics
- Coverage reports
- Improvement suggestions
```

## Purpose
Run the complete QA test suite to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. ALL tests must pass before proceeding with any work.

## Pre-execution Setup

1. **Check Test Environment**
   ```bash
   # Ensure dependencies are installed
   bun install
   
   # Verify test configuration exists
   test -f CLAUDE.md || echo "WARNING: CLAUDE.md not found"
   ```

2. **Identify Test Commands**
   - Look for CI/test commands in `package.json`
   - Check CLAUDE.md for specific QA instructions
   - Common commands: `bun run ci`, `bun test`, `bun run test:e2e`

## Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Run Full Test Suite
```bash
# Start with the CI command if available
bun run ci

# Or run individual test types
bun test                    # Unit tests
bun run test:integration    # Integration tests
bun run test:e2e           # End-to-end tests
```

### Step 2: Monitor Results
- **Green Path**: All tests pass → Proceed with confidence
- **Red Path**: ANY test fails → STOP and investigate

### Step 3: Failure Response Protocol
If any test fails:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - STOP all other work
   - Capture full error output
   - Note which test(s) failed

2. **Investigation**
   ```bash
   # Re-run failed test in isolation
   bun test path/to/failed.test.ts
   
   # Run with verbose output
   bun test --verbose
   
   # Check for environment issues
   bun run lint
   bun run typecheck
   ```

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Recent code changes that could cause failure
   - Missing dependencies or configuration
   - Environment-specific issues
   - Timing/async issues in tests

4. **Fix and Verify**
   - Apply minimal fix to resolve issue
   - Re-run specific failed test
   - Run full suite again to ensure no side effects

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Dependency errors | Run `bun install --force` |
| Type errors | Run `bun run typecheck` and fix |
| Lint errors | Run `bun run lint --fix` |
| Database issues | Check migrations: `bun run db:migrate` |
| Port conflicts | Kill processes on required ports |

## Success Criteria
✅ All unit tests pass
✅ All integration tests pass
✅ All E2E tests pass
✅ No type errors
✅ No lint errors
✅ Coverage thresholds met (if configured)

## Important Rules
- **NEVER** skip or comment out failing tests
- **NEVER** modify test expectations to make them pass
- **ALWAYS** fix the actual issue causing test failure
- **ALWAYS** run full suite after fixing individual tests

## Escape Hatches

### When QA is Challenging:

1. **Flaky Tests**
   - "Test X is failing intermittently (3/5 runs)"
   - "Appears to be a timing/race condition"
   - Option A: Add retry logic
   - Option B: Increase timeouts
   - Option C: Refactor test for stability

2. **Environment Issues**
   - "Tests pass locally but fail in CI"
   - "Differences detected: [list specifics]"
   - "Recommend: [environment alignment steps]"

3. **Performance Degradation**
   - "Tests taking [X%] longer than baseline"
   - "Main bottlenecks: [list slow tests]"
   - Option A: Parallelize test execution
   - Option B: Optimize slow tests
   - Option C: Accept new baseline

4. **Coverage Gaps**
   - "Coverage below threshold in [components]"
   - "Critical paths without tests: [list]"
   - "Risk assessment: [Low/Medium/High]"
   - "Should I add tests before proceeding?"

5. **Resource Constraints**
   - "Test suite consuming excessive resources"
   - "Memory: [XGB], CPU: [Y%]"
   - "Consider: splitting suites or upgrading runner"
